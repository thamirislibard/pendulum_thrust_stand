## Torsion Pendulum Microthrust Balance
Project dedicated to the design, development, and documentation of a highly sensitive microthrust balance based on the torsion pendulum principle. 

**Repository Contents:**

CAD Files: 3D models and engineering drawings for all mechanical components.

Electronics: Circuit diagrams, PCB layouts, and firmware for the control and data acquisition system.

Software: Python scripts for data analysis, MATLAB scripts for simulation, and control software for the balance.

Documentation: PDFs and markdown files containing detailed instructions, theoretical explanations, and research papers.

Test Data: Sample data sets from preliminary tests and calibration runs.

**Getting Started:**

Clone the Repository: Start by cloning this repository to your local machine.

Review Documentation: Begin with the README.md and docs/ directory for an overview and detailed instructions.

Build the Balance: Follow the assembly guide in the hardware/ directory to construct the torsion pendulum.

Set Up Electronics: Use the schematics and firmware in the electronics/ directory to set up the control system.

Run Experiments: Utilize the software in the software/ directory to conduct experiments and analyze data.

**Contributing:**
